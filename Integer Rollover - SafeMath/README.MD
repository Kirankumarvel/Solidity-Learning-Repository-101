##Integer Rollover - SafeMath

In earlier versions of Solidity (before version 0.8.0), arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division would wrap around in case of an overflow or underflow. This behavior was problematic because it could lead to unintended results, especially in financial applications where accurate calculations are critical. To handle this issue, developers commonly used the SafeMath library to add safety checks to these operations.

Let's break down this concept step-by-step.

## 1. What is Integer Rollover (Wrap Around)?

Integer rollover (or wrap around) occurs when an arithmetic operation exceeds the range of an integer type. Instead of throwing an error, the number "wraps around" to the other end of the range.

### Example of Wrap Around (Pre-0.8.0):

Using an unsigned integer (uint8):

```solidity
uint8 myUint = 0;
myUint -= 1; // Wraps around to 255 instead of throwing an error
```

In the above example:
- `uint8` can store values between 0 and 255.
- Subtracting 1 from 0 causes it to wrap around to 255.

This behavior was often unwanted and could lead to bugs or security vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

## 2. Why Use SafeMath Library?

Before Solidity 0.8.0, developers used libraries like SafeMath to prevent integer overflow and underflow by introducing explicit checks. SafeMath would revert the transaction if an operation resulted in an overflow or underflow.

### Example of SafeMath for Addition:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.7.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol";

contract SafeMathExample {
    using SafeMath for uint256; // Apply SafeMath library to uint256

    uint256 public value;

    function add(uint256 _value) public {
        value = value.add(_value); // Safe addition with overflow check
    }
}
```

`SafeMath.add` ensures that if the addition results in an overflow, the transaction reverts.

## 3. Changes in Solidity 0.8.0

Starting with Solidity 0.8.0, the compiler automatically checks for integer overflow and underflow. If an arithmetic operation exceeds the allowed range, it will revert the transaction instead of wrapping around. This means that you no longer need to use the SafeMath library in Solidity 0.8.0 and above.

### Example Without SafeMath (Post-0.8.0):

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract OverflowExample {
    uint8 public myUint = 255;

    function increment() public {
        myUint += 1; // This will revert instead of wrapping around
    }
}
```

In this example:
- Adding 1 to 255 will cause a revert because `uint8` cannot store values greater than 255.

## 4. Bringing Back Wrap Around Behavior with `unchecked` Blocks

In some cases, developers might want to reintroduce the old wrap-around behavior. Solidity 0.8.0 allows this using the `unchecked` block.

### Example of `unchecked` Block:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract WrapAroundExample {
    uint8 public myUint = 0;

    function decrement() public {
        unchecked {
            myUint -= 1; // Will wrap around to 255 instead of reverting
        }
    }
}
```

`unchecked` Block:
- Disables the automatic overflow/underflow checks.
- Useful for performance optimization or when wrap-around behavior is intentional.

## 5. Key Differences Between Checked and Unchecked Arithmetic

| Feature | Checked Arithmetic (Default in 0.8.0) | Unchecked Arithmetic (`unchecked` Block) |
|---------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Overflow/Underflow | Transaction reverts on overflow/underflow | Wraps around on overflow/underflow |
| Safety | Ensures arithmetic safety | May introduce unintended bugs |
| Use Case | Default behavior for most smart contracts | Specific cases where wrap-around behavior is desired |
| Performance | Slightly slower due to safety checks | Faster due to lack of safety checks |

## 6. Summary of SafeMath Library

- **Purpose**: Prevent overflow/underflow in Solidity versions before 0.8.0.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `SafeMath.add`: Safe addition.
  - `SafeMath.sub`: Safe subtraction.
  - `SafeMath.mul`: Safe multiplication.
  - `SafeMath.div`: Safe division.
- **Not Needed in**: Solidity 0.8.0 and later, because the compiler enforces these checks natively.

## Final Thoughts

- **Pre-0.8.0**: Use SafeMath to avoid overflow/underflow.
- **Post-0.8.0**: The compiler handles arithmetic safety by default, but you can use `unchecked` blocks to restore wrap-around behavior.
- **SafeMath Legacy**: If you see SafeMath in older contracts, understand it was necessary for safety before Solidity 0.8.0.
