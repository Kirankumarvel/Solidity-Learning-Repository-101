### Detailed Explanation of Address Type in Solidity

---

In Solidity, the **address type** is a unique and fundamental data type used to represent **Ethereum addresses** or **accounts**. Let's break down the key concepts, use cases, and features related to addresses, along with the code examples provided.

---

## What is the Address Type?

- **Address Type** stores a **20-byte** Ethereum address (160 bits).
- Ethereum addresses are used to represent:
  - **Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs)**: Regular user wallets.
  - **Smart Contract Accounts**: Contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
- Addresses are typically represented in **hexadecimal format**, starting with `0x`.

Example of an Ethereum address:  
```
0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
```

---

## Features of the Address Type

### 1. Default Value

- When an address variable is declared but not initialized, it defaults to the **zero address**:
  ```
  0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
  ```
- This is a 20-byte address filled with zeros.

### 2. Balance Property

- Addresses have a built-in `balance` property that returns the amount of **Wei** held by that address.
- **Wei** is the smallest unit of Ether (1 Ether = 10^18 Wei).

### 3. Immutable Nature

- Once a smart contract is deployed, addresses (for accounts or contracts) cannot be changed.

## Example Code

Here's a detailed breakdown of the code and its functionalities:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ExampleAddress {
    // Declare a public address variable
    address public someAddress;

    // Function to set the address
    function setSomeAddress(address _someAddress) public {
        someAddress = _someAddress;
    }

    // Function to get the balance of the stored address
    function getAddressBalance() public view returns (uint256) {
        return someAddress.balance;
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Declaration of `someAddress`**  
   ```solidity
   address public someAddress;
   ```
   - This line declares a public variable of type `address`. By default, it is initialized to the zero address (`0x000...000`).

2. **Function to Set an Address**  
   ```solidity
   function setSomeAddress(address _someAddress) public {
       someAddress = _someAddress;
   }
   ```
   - This function takes an address as an input and sets the value of `someAddress`.
   - The input must be a valid 20-byte Ethereum address.

3. **Function to Get the Balance**  
   ```solidity
   function getAddressBalance() public view returns (uint256) {
       return someAddress.balance;
   }
   ```
   - This function returns the balance of the address stored in `someAddress`.
   - The balance is returned in **Wei** (the smallest denomination of Ether).

---

## How to Interact with the Contract

1. **Deploy the Contract**:  
   Deploy the contract using Remix IDE or any Ethereum-compatible environment.

2. **Set an Address**:  
   - Call `setSomeAddress` and pass a valid Ethereum address (e.g., `0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678`).

3. **Check the Balance**:  
   - Call `getAddressBalance` to check how much Ether is held by the specified address.

## Understanding Balance and Wei

### What is Wei?

- **Wei** is the smallest denomination of Ether.
- 1 Ether = **10^18 Wei** (1,000,000,000,000,000,000 Wei).

### Example Denominations

| **Unit**          | **Value in Wei**                        | **Description**                    |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Wei**           | 1 Wei                                   | Smallest unit                     |
| **Gwei**          | 1,000,000,000 (10^9 Wei)                | Commonly used for gas fees        |
| **Ether (ETH)**   | 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (10^18 Wei)   | Primary Ethereum currency         |

Example: If an address holds **1 Ether**, `someAddress.balance` will return `1000000000000000000` Wei.

## Practical Use Cases

1. **Storing Wallet Addresses**:  
   - Keeping track of addresses involved in a contract (e.g., owners, recipients).

2. **Checking Balances**:  
   - Verifying if an address has enough balance before performing an operation.

3. **Sending Ether**:  
   - Facilitating transfers between accounts (covered in more advanced topics).

4. **Access Control**:  
   - Restricting certain functions to specific addresses (e.g., only the contract owner can call a function).

---

## Example Transaction Flow

1. **Set an Address**:  
   Call `setSomeAddress` with an Ethereum address (e.g., `0xAbC...123`).

2. **Check Balance**:  
   Call `getAddressBalance` to check the balance in Wei. If the address holds `1 ETH`, the function returns `1000000000000000000`.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Addresses** store Ethereum account or contract addresses (20 bytes).
2. They default to the **zero address** (`0x000...000`).
3. The `balance` property returns the amount of Wei held by the address.
4. **Wei** is the smallest denomination of Ether.
5. Address manipulation is essential for smart contract interactions, particularly when handling funds or managing access control.

Understanding addresses is fundamental to Ethereum development, enabling secure and accurate contract operations.
